	// this keeps track of which card is where.  the open deck and discard
	// pile are assumed to be visible, as are the size of the deck and of
	// the players' hands.
	// we get partial knowledge about the players' cards by looking at the
	// cards they draw from the open deck.  we get partial knowledge about
	// the content of the deck when the discard pile is reshuffled and
	// becomes the deck.
	// we lose knowledge when a player draws a card from the closed deck.
	// when sampling, we construct the deck and players' hands by first
	// taking the bag of cards that we know for certain are in there, and
	// then add cards from cards_of_unknown_location such that the sampled
	// hand has the same size as the real hand.
	// we could use the observations we get more efficiently by keeping,
	// for each card in some hidden bag, a probability distribution over
	// the colors.  this would greatly complicate likelihood calculation and
	// sampling.
	// the present less accurate way actually works surprisingly well, so
	// it's probably good enough.  it works well because the players tend
	// to draw lots of open cards, keep small hands, and often end up with
	// empty hands after claiming some railway.  in a 1v1 game where one of
	// the players' hands is visible, the other player's hand being empty
	// means the location of each card is known, and the likelihood of
	// reality is 1 (at least as far as cards are concerned).
	
	// for missions, we infer a probability distribution over the whereabouts
	// of each mission.  a mission can either be in the mission deck or in
	// possession of one of the players.  the inference of the distribution
	// is wildly heuristic: the non-normalized probability of each player-
	// mission pair is the average of the relevances to the missions of each
	// railway that has been claimed by the player, times the number of
	// missions that the player has.

	// finally, we make no attempt to infer the random state, so in sample,
	// a random random state is chosen.
